Hi,

That's my solution for GRM Developer test. To run the console app, open console go to RR.GRM.Console\publish and type:
	dotnet .\RR.GRM.Console.dll

I ran into some problems when composing BDD tests from the acceptance criteria from the spec. I foolishly based my test project on .NET Core too. It took some time to research the problem and then I ran out of time.
